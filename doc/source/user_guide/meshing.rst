Meshing in PyPrime
-------------------
PyPrime uses Prime meshing engine that empowers the meshing needs of your application. 
Prime supports single process, multi-threaded and distributed parallel modes. You can choose any mode based on your requirements. 
PyPrime allows you to generate a tetrahedral, hexcore, or hybrid volume mesh from an existing boundary mesh. 
Also, generates tetrahedral, hexcore, or hybrid volume mesh based on meshing objects from a faceted geometry.
